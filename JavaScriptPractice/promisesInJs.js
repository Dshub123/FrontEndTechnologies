/******** Promises *********/
/*
A Promise object represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value. Promises provide a
robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result of asynchronous work, mitigating the problem of deeply nested
callbacks (known as "callback hell").

A promise can be in one of three states:
pending — The underlying operation has not yet completed, and the promise is pending fulfillment.

fulfilled — The operation has finished, and the promise is fulfilled with a value. This is analogous to returning a
value from a synchronous function.

rejected — An error has occurred during the operation, and the promise is rejected with a reason. This is
analogous to throwing an error in a synchronous function.
